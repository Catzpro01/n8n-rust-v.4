# Golden Reference Workflows

Kumpulan workflow referensi standar untuk menguji kepatuhan validator dan engine Rust terhadap n8n asli:
1. `01-empty-workflow`: Validasi workflow kosong.
2. `02-one-node`: Validasi satu node trigger tanpa koneksi.
3. `03-linear`: Validasi alur linear sederhana (Trigger -> Code).

## GOLDEN REFERENCE PROTECTION (Agent 5 — brief §13)

Files under `tests/reference/` are **golden**: they encode observed n8n 2.9.4 behavior.

**A golden fixture or expected result may never be changed to make a failing test pass.**

Any change to `tests/reference/**` must be accompanied, in the same commit message or in a
`docs/isolation/CROSS-AGENT-ISSUES.md` entry, by all four of:

1. **Evidence** — actual output from n8n 2.9.4 (HTTP response, CLI output, DB row).
2. **Reason** — why the previously recorded behavior was wrong.
3. **Source reference** — `reference/n8n/...` file:line implementing the new behavior.
4. **Behavior explanation** — what changes for a downstream consumer.

A golden change without all four is **REJECTED** by the integration gate.
The 11/11 baseline in `baseline/SMOKE_TEST_RESULTS.md` is immutable for Phase 2.

## Execution Data & Expression reference cases (Agent 3)

Behavioural cases recorded from the **real** n8n 2.9.4 runtime packages
(`n8n-core@2.9.1` + `n8n-workflow@2.9.1`, the exact versions pinned by `n8n@2.9.4`).
`expected.json` files are never hand-written – they are snapshots of observed behaviour.

```text

Run:

```bash
cd tests/reference/harness
npm install                      # pulls n8n-core@2.9.1 / n8n-workflow@2.9.1 (not committed)
node run.js                      # all 13 cases
node run.js execution-data       # 7 cases
node run.js expression           # 6 cases
UPDATE=1 node run.js             # re-snapshot from the runtime (only when the reference version changes)
```

Each case directory: `case.json` (input), `expected.json` (observed 2.9.4 output), `README.md` (what it proves).
A case whose behaviour cannot be proven from the runtime must have `{"UNKNOWN": "<reason>"}` as `expected.json`; currently there are none.

Contracts: `contracts/execution-data.contract.md`, `contracts/expression.contract.md`.
Isolation docs: `docs/isolation/execution-data.md`, `docs/isolation/expression.md`, `docs/isolation/dependencies.md`.

## Connection reference cases (Agent 3, LEGO `connection`)

```text
tests/reference/connection/
├── 01-linear
├── 02-multi-output
├── 03-connection-types
├── 04-cycle
└── 05-connections-diff
```
Run `node run.js connection` from `tests/reference/harness` (5 cases). Contract: `contracts/connection.contract.md`; isolation: `docs/isolation/connection.md`.

### connection cases 06–07 (added after Phase 2 gate)

| Case | Pins |
| :--- | :--- |
| `06-rename-stale-destination` | D-08 end-to-end: after `renameNode(A→A2)` the source map is fresh (`children of Trigger` = `[B, A2]`), the destination map is stale (`parents of B` = `[Trigger, A]`, `parents of A2` = `[]`), `getNodeConnectionIndexes(B, A2)` = `undefined`; `setConnections(sameMap)` rebuilds it. Closes the coverage gap Agent 1 handed to Agent 5 in MSG-12. |
| `07-parent-main-input-ai-tool` | `getParentMainInputNode` climbing `ai_tool` outputs (one and two hops) — the path case 03 could not pin because its stub declared `main` outputs only. Harness stub now: `SubTool*` → `outputs: ['ai_tool']`, `Agent` → `inputs: ['main','ai_tool']`. |

### connection seam package (`packages/connection-lego/`, core directive)

The same 7 cases are replayed through the seam facade `packages/connection-lego/src/model-surface.ts`
(pure probes only; `wf.*` probes stay in this harness because they belong to the Workflow class, LEGO 01):

```bash
cd packages/connection-lego
node --test test/*.test.mjs                        # reference mode → 17/17
LEGO_PORT_MODE=strict node --test test/*.test.mjs  # strict mode (vendored reference source, no node_modules) → 17/17
```
