"""Agent 5 — task-result integrity audit (Stage 2B of run_gate.sh).

A `results/TASK-*.md` file is an ASSERTION that work happened. This audit checks the
assertion against the repository, because a status line costs nothing to write:

  T1  STATUS: SUCCESS with an EMPTY "Pipeline Operations Summary" table
      -> the pipeline recorded no operation, so SUCCESS is unsupported.
  T2  WITHDRAWN before shipping. It flagged "the result's commit touched only
      results/" as a missing deliverable. Verified false: the Arena Gateway commits
      result files SEPARATELY from the agent's work (e.g. TASK-201's result is commit
      6ce9df42, results-only, while its deliverable docs/isolation/workflow.md was
      committed in 6dc25f44). T2 fired on 10 of 17 results, nearly all of them real
      work. A check that indicts correct behaviour is worse than no check.

Reported, never auto-fixed: Agent 5 documents and reassigns, it does not own other
agents' LEGO internals.
