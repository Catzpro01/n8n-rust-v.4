# n8n-rust-v.4

High-Performance Rust Port of n8n with Arena AI Virtual SSH Engine.

The port never rewrites n8n from guesswork: n8n 2.9.4 is the behavioral
reference, every component is isolated behind an explicit contract, and only then
is a Rust replacement attempted.

## Project status

| Stage | State |
| :--- | :--- |
| ANATOMY (`docs/anatomy/`) | ✅ Completed |
| CONTRACT (`contracts/`) | ✅ Completed |
| REFERENCE SOURCE (`reference/n8n/`, n8n 2.9.4) | ✅ Completed |
| REFERENCE RUNTIME (baseline 11/11 smoke test) | ✅ Completed |
| WORKFLOW ISOLATION & LEGOS (01–04) | ✅ VERIFIED |
| **CURRENT PHASE** | **🚀 PHASE 3 — RUST RUNTIME (ACTIVE)** |
| RUST IMPLEMENTATION (8 Workspace Crates) | ✅ **ACTIVE** (`crates/` compiled & passing all tests) |

## Governance & Single Source of Truth (P0 Constitution)

Proyek ini berada di bawah tata kelola arsitektur tunggal (P0 Governance):
1. **Fase Resmi: PHASE 3 — RUST RUNTIME (ACTIVE)**. Fase isolasi Phase 2 telah selesai dan terverifikasi. Seluruh pengembangan runtime saat ini berada di Phase 3.
2. **Status Rust: ACTIVE**. Status Rust bukan lagi "not started" atau "reserved". Cargo workspace mendefinisikan dan mengompilasi 8 crates aktif (`n8n-common`, `n8n-workflow`, `n8n-connection`, `n8n-validation`, `n8n-node-model`, `n8n-execution-data`, `n8n-expression`, `n8n-nodes-rust`).
3. **Single Source of Truth**: Branch `main` adalah satu-satunya acuan kebenaran mutlak bagi semua agen. Dilarang melakukan rollback ke zero-Rust atau mengklaim fase sebelum Phase 3.
4. **Compatibility Baseline (n8n v2.9.4)**: Perilaku referensi n8n v2.9.4 dan kontrak formal dipertahankan penuh sebagai standar keabsahan perilaku engine.
5. **LEGO = Development Boundary, Bukan Runtime Overhead**: Pembagian LEGO hanya berfungsi sebagai batas modul dan pemisahan tugas saat isolasi/pengembangan. Pada hot-path runtime, engine tidak memecah eksekusi menjadi lapisan serialisasi JSON / IPC antar-crate yang berat, melainkan menggunakan representasi Runtime IR terpadu dengan alokasi minimal/zero-copy.
6. **Feature & Node Freeze**: Penambahan node baru dibekukan sementara hingga arsitektur Kernel Runtime IR (P1: `ExecutionContext`, `ExecutionFrame`, `NodeExecutor`, Data Plane) dibakukan.

## Overall Milestone Progress

Status is not progress. Both percentages below are generated from [`docs/n8n-lego/milestones.json`](docs/n8n-lego/milestones.json). They are not estimated from time, PR count or lines of code. Rounding is half-up to one decimal, never a ceiling.

### Realtime Delivery Progress

**87.0%**

`█████████████████░░░ 87.0%`

Checkpoint-weighted earned points / current-delivery points: 12700 / 14600. Denominator: programs P0–P11 only (146 active slices). Future programs are excluded. 3 slice(s) declare checkpoints. 125 implemented slice(s) have no checkpoint list and contribute 100 each. 18 slice(s) have no checkpoint model and contribute 0. A 0 from a missing model is not a measured fraction of that slice.

### Slice Completion

**87.0%**

`█████████████████░░░ 87.0%`

**127 / 146 slices implemented** in the same P0–P11 denominator. Only `implemented` increases this numerator. Verifying, blocked, in-progress, planned, proposed and deferred contribute 0. Superseded, retired and rejected stay out of the denominator.

## Active Execution

### Active work

The queue is `executionPointer` only. Historical `P2.27` is not the next slice, and there is no `P2.28`.

```text
 1. `P5-M07` in-progress; realtime 0.0%; completion contribution 0.0%; updated 2026-09-26T00:00:00Z

_No verifying slice._

### Blocked

- 🔴 **P5-M02** — Credential runtime integration. Status: BLOCKED. Realtime 0.0%. No checkpoint model is declared, so realtime progress stays 0.0%. That 0 is not a measured fraction of the work, and evidenced work is not converted into a percentage. Current checkpoint: none declared. Latest checkpoint: none declared. Checkpoint evidence: — (no completed checkpoint). Blocker: P6-S04 (proposed, #116): the engine has no credential-consuming node. packages/reconstructed-engine/node-registry.mjs implements only manualTrigger, start, noOp, set, code, function and functionItem, so SecretRef resolution in the execution path has no consumer (Manager finding, verified against main 600a2145). Last progress update: —. Completion contribution: 0%.
- 🔴 **P5-M05** — Multi-host key storage and shared session + rate-limiter state. Status: BLOCKED. Realtime 0.0%. No checkpoint model is declared, so realtime progress stays 0.0%. That 0 is not a measured fraction of the work, and evidenced work is not converted into a percentage. Current checkpoint: none declared. Latest checkpoint: none declared. Checkpoint evidence: — (no completed checkpoint). Blocker: P8-S01 (planned, not authorized): the P8 storage contract that shared key/session/rate-limiter state needs. Last progress update: —. Completion contribution: 0%.
- 🔴 **P5-M06** — Email-based password recovery. Status: BLOCKED. Realtime 0.0%. No checkpoint model is declared, so realtime progress stays 0.0%. That 0 is not a measured fraction of the work, and evidenced work is not converted into a percentage. Current checkpoint: none declared. Latest checkpoint: none declared. Checkpoint evidence: — (no completed checkpoint). Blocker: a mail-transport architecture decision (a dependency, or an injected transport contract); Node has no built-in SMTP. Last progress update: —. Completion contribution: 0%.
- 🔴 **P5-M10** — Public /api/v1 resources that need a backing model this product does not have yet. Status: BLOCKED. Realtime 0.0%. No checkpoint model is declared, so realtime progress stays 0.0%. That 0 is not a measured fraction of the work, and evidenced work is not converted into a percentage. Current checkpoint: none declared. Latest checkpoint: none declared. Checkpoint evidence: — (no completed checkpoint). Blocker: backing models this product does not have: projects/sharing, security audit, source control, data tables, workflow versions, a retry execution path, execution annotation tags (see P5-M08-EVIDENCE.md §1). Last progress update: —. Completion contribution: 0%.

Planned queue (planned ≠ authorized): `P9-S01` → `P3-S01` → `P4-S01` → `P6-S01` → `P6-S02` → `P2-S02` → `P2-S03`.

Not authorized: planned is not authorized: the Manager starts a queued slice by moving it to in-progress in a PR on main. P5-M04 is planned and measure-first. P7-S01, P8-S01, P10-S01 and P11-S01 are placeholders that need a Manager Master Prompt before any work.

## Status Legend

- 🟡 Planned — 0% until an evidenced checkpoint exists. Completion contribution 0%
- 🔴 Blocked — last evidenced checkpoint progress is kept. The blocker stays visible. Completion contribution 0%
- ⚪ Proposed — 0%. Completion contribution 0%
- Deferred — prior evidenced checkpoint progress if declared, otherwise 0%. Completion contribution 0%

## P10 — Multi-Tenant / Isolation / Quota

- **Realtime Delivery Progress:** **0.0%** `░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0.0%`
- **Slice Completion:** **0.0%** (0 / 1 implemented). Remaining 1. 0 implemented, 1 planned.
- **Program status:** planned. Program status is not a percentage and is not 100% just because the word is complete.
- **Purpose:** Only when required: tenant lifecycle, storage/compute/capability isolation, per-tenant budgets, noisy-neighbor protection, tenant administration (#90, #78). Single-tenant remains the first target.
- **Checkpoint model:** 0 slice(s) declare checkpoints; 0 implemented slice(s) use the legacy 100 rule; 1 slice(s) have no checkpoint model and stay at 0.0%.

## Historical P2 ladder

17 completed milestones (`P2.11` … `P2.27`, with the `P2.27.x` sub-slices under program P2) are immutable implementation history. Historical pointers: current `P2.27`, previous completed `P2.26` (history, not active work). The generic `P2.17+` (planned) row is a historical placeholder label; it authorizes no work.

## Milestone Governance

- **Milestone authority:** `main` owns milestone truth (DEC-0020). Canonical register: [`docs/n8n-lego/milestones.json`](docs/n8n-lego/milestones.json); generated projections: this section of `README.md`, `.ai/master/MILESTONE_REGISTER.md` and `.ai/master/CURRENT_STATUS.md`. `arena-manager` is Manager planning memory only (canonical: false); `docs/n8n-lego/ROADMAP.md` is strategy narrative and owns no status.
- **Live progress (DEC-0021, LIVE-MILESTONE EXCEPTION):** checkpoint progress, checkpoint status, checkpoint evidence, current checkpoint, slice / program / overall progress and the milestone evidence of a slice still in flight are operational telemetry. The Manager may reconcile them straight to `main` in a `governance(progress):` commit, without a governance PR, with `node tools/lego/progress-event.mjs record --slice <id> --checkpoint <CP-nn> --status <status> --evidence <reference>`. The tool runs the whole atomic chain: validate evidence and weights → write the register → regenerate `README.md` and `.ai` → run `npm run lego:ai:check` → commit → push → verify `main`. One measurable event is one commit; live progress is never batched and a partial state is never published. The Manager never types a percentage: `resolve` derives the state from evidence — `--fetch` reads the DEC-0015 jobs and the runner availability from the GitHub API, `--jobs <file.json>` reads an export, and `verify --cmd` derives completed / blocked from a verification command's exit code. A checkpoint that declares `requires` is earned only when every named check has passed; an absent self-hosted check is never PASS and `WAITING_RUNNER` is never PASS, so a head that never ran the suite cannot look green. Two paths, never mixed: delivery state is implementation → delivery PR → merge → post-merge verification → one governance PR reconciling status, merge SHA, evidence and projections; telemetry is evidence → checkpoint update → register → README → .ai → a `governance(progress):` commit → main. A slice status becoming `implemented` is delivery state and is never telemetry. The exception never covers source code, tests, runtime behaviour, API / frontend / backend / contract / schema implementation, dependencies, packages, Rust code, CI workflows, security policy, permissions, infrastructure, database schema or production configuration — those still go through a delivery PR. Live telemetry never bypasses a completion gate: 100% realtime progress with a completion contribution of 0% is a legitimate state, and only `implemented` (DEC-0014 + DEC-0015) moves Slice Completion.
- **Rule:** Milestone truth is main-owned. A milestone design found or developed in Manager memory becomes authoritative only when reconciled into main through a PR. arena-manager is not an alternate milestone authority, and its docs/ tree is a stale snapshot that is never copied over main.
- **Pending reconciliation:** A milestone change that exists only on arena-manager, a local worktree, a handoff, an issue, a PR body or chat is a proposal (pending reconciliation), never authoritative truth. A PR proposes a milestone state; only the merged state on main is authoritative.
- **Freshness:** generated by `npm run lego:ai` from register 2.3.0 (fingerprint `b00b0b6aef3db7d1`); `npm run lego:ai:check` fails when this section, the `.ai` pack or the register disagree.
- **Progress model (Issue #307):** Realtime Delivery Progress is checkpoint-weighted across P0-P11. Slice Completion is implemented / active in that same denominator. Future programs stay visible and are excluded from the current-delivery denominator. Illustrations of the status/progress split are not register measurements and must not be copied into slice checkpoints. The generator counts only weights declared on slice.checkpoints. It does not invent weights. A completed checkpoint requires evidence. Weights on a slice must sum to 100. A slice with no checkpoint model stays at 0 unless it is implemented, in which case the legacy rule contributes 100. This projection is not canonical until the change is on main.
- **Completion KPI:** Slice Completion is implemented slices / active slices in P0–P11. A verifying or blocked slice never increases that numerator. Realtime Delivery Progress is a separate checkpoint-weighted figure and can move while Slice Completion stays still.
- **Purpose field:** a slice purpose is `slice.purpose` when present, otherwise the text after the first `: ` in the canonical title, otherwise the title. No purpose is invented.
- **Top level:** programs P0–P11 only. There is no P12+ or P24+ and no P5.9; legacy P12–P23 are consolidated into future programs. New work is `Pn-Snn`, `Pn-Mnn` or `FUTURE-<THEME>-Snn`.
- **Post-merge sequence:** delivery PR → merge to main → post-merge verification → register status and evidence update → README milestone projection (generated) → .ai regeneration → governance PR → merge governance PR → final main verification.
- **No batching:** Nothing is batched into a later roadmap cleanup. A delivery-state change (planned -> in-progress at slice start, in-progress -> implemented, a split or a new blocker) is recorded by the next governance PR; every evidenced progress event is recorded immediately in its own governance(progress): commit, because the repository is the live project monitor (DEC-0021).
- **Completion rule:** Immediately after merge + post-merge verification, the slice and its features become implemented with PR, merge SHA, tests and evidence; remaining debt is recorded as Pn-Mnn. An open PR means in-progress, never implemented.
- One delivery PR per slice (DEC-0014); the post-merge register/README/.ai reconciliation of a delivery is a separate governance PR, not a second delivery PR. Progress telemetry is the other path (DEC-0021) and never carries delivery state.
- A slice cycle is closed only when implementation, register, this README section, the generated `.ai` and evidence agree on `main`.
- Evidence lives in `docs/n8n-lego/evidence/`; each slice's `evidence` field names its file.
<!-- END GENERATED milestone-governance -->

## Structure

- `reference/n8n/` : pristine upstream n8n 2.9.4 source (read-only, hash-pinned)
- `docs/anatomy/` : system anatomy (18 documents)
- `contracts/` : formal LEGO contracts (`workflow`, `node`, `connection`, `validation`)
- `docs/isolation/` : Phase 2 isolation records, dependency map, port contract, verification report
- `packages/workflow-lego/` : the isolated Workflow Model LEGO (boundary, ports, tests, manifests)
- `tools/` : boundary mapper, kernel/port/reference gates, isolation extractor, model digest, gate runner, live engine harness
- `tests/reference/` : golden workflows + baseline smoke test evidence
- `tasks/`, `results/` : inbound task manifests and execution results
- `crates/` : active Rust implementation workspace (8 member crates)
- `docs/isolation/trigger-rust-port.md` : `trigger.lifecycle` port record (symbol map, divergences, evidence)
- `apps/n8n-rust/` : application entry point & runner

## Verify Rust Workspace

```bash
cargo check --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

Without registry access (sandbox / review boxes) the offline rig builds the same crates
against the exact `Cargo.lock` versions; `n8n-nodes-rust` stays with the CI runner because
its `tokio` dev-dependency closure is not vendored:

```bash
tools/rust-offline-rig/setup.sh     # toolchain from npm + vendored crates from git
tools/rust-offline-rig/run.sh test
```

## Verify a Reference LEGO

```bash
scripts/setup-reference-runtime.sh        # n8n-workflow/core/nodes-base 2.9.1 == the n8n 2.9.4 dependency set
npm install --prefix packages/workflow-lego
npm run verify                            # 11 gates; writes docs/isolation/evidence/*

npm run verify:fast                       # same, without the live engine checks
npm run isolation:check                   # boundary + kernel + port + reference-integrity only
```

A failing gate means the isolation is void and must be rolled back — the records
are machine-readable in `docs/isolation/evidence/`.

## TypeScript baseline runtime (usable track)

Track terpisah yang membuat LEGO TypeScript bisa dipakai hari ini
(install → start → deploy VPS) sementara Rust tetap beku di track ini:

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh && bash scripts/start.sh && bash scripts/doctor.sh
npm run ts:test   # adapter (14) + runtime nyata (44) + integrasi (3)
```
