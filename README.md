# n8n-rust-v.4

High-Performance Rust Port of n8n with Arena AI Virtual SSH Engine.

The port never rewrites n8n from guesswork: n8n 2.9.4 is the behavioral
reference, every component is isolated behind an explicit contract, and only then
is a Rust replacement attempted.

## Project status

| stage | state |
| :--- | :--- |
| ANATOMY (`docs/anatomy/`) | ✅ |
| CONTRACT (`contracts/`) | ✅ |
| REFERENCE SOURCE (`reference/n8n/`, n8n 2.9.4) | ✅ |
| REFERENCE RUNTIME (baseline 11/11 smoke test) | ✅ |
| **WORKFLOW ISOLATION (LEGO 01)** | **✅ VERIFIED — see [`docs/isolation/workflow.md`](docs/isolation/workflow.md)** |
| NODE MODEL (LEGO 02) · CONNECTION (03) · VALIDATION (04) | **✅ contracts + reference fixtures present** |
| RUST PORT / PHASE 3 PREFLIGHT | **⚠️ in progress — offline rig + reference-driven tests** |

“Isolated” means the TypeScript component now has an enforced boundary and a
contract. It does **not** mean it was replaced by Rust. The current Rust crates
are Phase-3 port work; the live integration gate remains separate and must not be
called verified until its VPS run and formal Phase-3 decision record exist.

## Structure

- `reference/n8n/` : pristine upstream n8n 2.9.4 source (read-only, hash-pinned)
- `docs/anatomy/` : system anatomy (18 documents)
- `contracts/` : formal LEGO contracts (`workflow`, `node`, `connection`, `validation`)
- `docs/isolation/` : Phase 2 isolation records, dependency map, port contract, verification report
- `packages/workflow-lego/` : the isolated Workflow Model LEGO (boundary, ports, tests, manifests)
- `tools/` : boundary mapper, kernel/port/reference gates, isolation extractor, model digest, gate runner, live engine harness
- `tests/reference/` : golden workflows + baseline smoke test evidence
- `tasks/`, `results/` : inbound task manifests and execution results
- `crates/`, `apps/n8n-rust/` : Phase-3 Rust port (not yet a runtime replacement)
- `tools/rust-offline-rig/` : reproducible cargo/rustc verification without crates.io

## Verify a LEGO

```bash
scripts/setup-reference-runtime.sh        # n8n-workflow/core/nodes-base 2.9.1 == the n8n 2.9.4 dependency set
npm install --prefix packages/workflow-lego
npm run verify                            # 11 gates; writes docs/isolation/evidence/*

npm run verify:fast                       # same, without the live engine checks
npm run isolation:check                   # boundary + kernel + port + reference-integrity only
```

A failing gate means the isolation is void and must be rolled back — the records
are machine-readable in `docs/isolation/evidence/`.
