/**
 * Backend LEGO foundation — the operation envelope, cancellation and deadlines.
 *
 * PUBLIC CONTRACT (`lego.envelope`, v1.0.0, owner: agent-2).
 *
 * P2.8-B declared the envelope's ten fields as vocabulary. This module makes it
 * real, and it is the piece the four interaction classes all sit on.
 *
 * THE CONSTRAINT THAT SHAPES EVERYTHING HERE: the envelope must be cheap enough
 * to create on every in-process call. A workflow executing 400 nodes creates 400
 * envelopes. So this is a plain frozen object and an AbortController — no
 * classes with prototypes to walk, no serialization, no clock syscall unless a
 * deadline was actually requested, no allocation that a direct call would not
 * otherwise make. `createEnvelope()` on a hot path costs roughly what building
 * an options object costs, which is the whole point: if the envelope were
 * expensive, callers would skip it and the architecture would lose its identity
 * and cancellation story at exactly the moment it matters.
 *
 * TRANSPORT NEUTRALITY: the envelope carries no transport concept. `signal` is
 * the one field that cannot cross a process boundary, so `serializeEnvelope()`
 * drops it and records `cancellable: false` — a worker binding re-establishes
 * cancellation with its own channel rather than pretending an AbortSignal
 * survived the trip. Everything else round-trips as plain JSON.
